          <h2>What are fish farms?</h2>
          <p>Fish farming, also known as aquaculture, is the practice of raising fish in controlled 
            environments, including tanks, enclosures, or offshore pens, designed to meet the growing 
            global demand for seafood. Originally developed to reduce the strain on wild fish populations 
            and create a steady, reliable food source, fish farms are now common worldwide. They are seen 
            as a solution to overfishing and as a way to stabilize seafood supply chains, particularly for 
            high-demand species such as tuna and salmon. However, the practices within fish farming have 
            raised several environmental, ethical, and health concerns.<br><br>

            In Malta, the fish farming industry has grown significantly, with most operations focused on 
            high-value species, especially bluefin tuna, intended for export. While fish farms have helped 
            Malta participate in the global seafood trade and created local employment, the environmental 
            and social consequences have stirred public debate. The confined conditions in Maltese fish 
            farms can generate waste and pollution that impact nearby marine ecosystems and create concerns 
            about the spread of disease to native species. As fish farms grow in scale, they continue to 
            influence both the local environment and the quality of seafood available in Malta.</p>

          <h2>Animal Welfare</h2>
          <p>Animal welfare in fish farming remains one of the most pressing ethical issues within the 
            aquaculture industry. Fish farms often involve dense populations of fish in restricted 
            environments, which can lead to chronic stress, physical injuries, and increased 
            susceptibility to diseases and parasites. High stocking densities mean fish have limited 
            space, which impedes natural behaviors and can cause aggression or injury among individuals. 
            Furthermore, farmed fish are often subjected to handling and transport methods that can lead 
            to further stress and mortality, which impacts not only the health of individual fish but 
            the overall quality of the harvest.<br><br>

            In Malta, animal welfare within fish farms is a growing concern, especially given the 
            country’s focus on bluefin tuna—a species requiring large swimming spaces and often housed 
            in confined sea cages. Local welfare advocates argue that the industry needs stricter 
            regulations to ensure fish are treated humanely and that living conditions meet welfare 
            standards. The Maltese aquaculture industry is encouraged to adopt practices such as 
            reducing stocking densities, improving water quality, and using more humane handling 
            techniques. By prioritizing welfare, Malta could enhance the quality of farmed fish while 
            also addressing ethical concerns related to the treatment of fish in these facilities.</p>
